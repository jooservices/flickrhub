# Documentation Index

This repository contains two documentation sets:

- `master/`: Architecture Center submodule. Treat as read-only here; update via upstream PRs.
- `flickrhub/`: Project-specific docs for FlickrHub. See `docs/flickrhub/00-index/README.md` for navigation.

When adding or updating project docs, place them under `docs/flickrhub/` following the structure in `docs/flickrhub/08-meta/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md`. Keep links relative to that directory. Do not modify `docs/master` directly.
